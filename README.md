# Azure-Data-Factory-Covid19-Analysis

## Overview
Built a data ingestion pipeline in Azure Data lake to Visualize Countries With Highest Corona Virus Hospital Admissions Using Azure Data Factory(ADF), Azure Data Studio, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, Dataflow, Data Brick Transformation and Hd-insight
build production ready pipelines and create CI/CD pipelines in Azure Devops to release ADF pipelines to higher environments (Testing/ Production)

## Features
- Data Ingestion: Utilizes ADF to ingest Covid-19 data from various sources, ensuring a continuous flow of updated information.
- Data Transformation: Cleanses and transforms raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- Data Analysis: Conducts thorough analysis on Covid-19 data, extracting meaningful insights such as trends, geographical distribution, and demographic impacts.
- Visualization: Generates interactive visualizations using tools like Power BI, providing intuitive representations of the analyzed data.
- Automated Pipelines: Implements automated data pipelines within Azure Data Factory for seamless and efficient data processing.
- Scalability: Leverages the scalability of Azure services to handle large volumes of data and accommodate future growth.
- Customization: Allows for customization and extension to adapt to specific requirements or incorporate additional datasets.

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with access to Azure Data Factory and other required services.
- Basic understanding of Azure Data Factory concepts and data processing pipelines.
- Covid-19 datasets or sources accessible for ingestion.
